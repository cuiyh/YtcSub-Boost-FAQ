# 3.Why sometimes click the button without any feedback?
The YouTube Data Api may have more than 10,000 quotas. YouTube officially limits 10,000 quotas per day, which is not something developers can control. If it is exceeded, it is invalid. As a result, you wonâ€™t see any performance feedback in your app, you can use it the next day, and YouTube will automatically reset the next day.

# 4.Is there any activity to earn points?
If you think this app is a little bit useful for you, you can help me make a good rating. Then send your rating screenshot, email address and your username to cyhlife@gmail.com, I will give your account a 1000 points to thank you, of course, this is entirely voluntary.
