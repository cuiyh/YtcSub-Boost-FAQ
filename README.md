# 4.Can I publish channel information continuously?
Will automatically delete more than two consecutive channel information.

# 5.Please Note：Why the app is not working?
This app is done by calling the official YouTube API to publish and subscribe to the channel.After 10,000 API quotas are used up that day, the app will not be able to subscribe to and publish any channel information. Because this is the official limitation of YouTube, only 10,000 apis are allowed to be called each day.The next day will reset 10,000 api quotas. You can earn points by watching a video ad, then reset the api the next day and continue to use it.And there are a lot of people using this app, they will run out of 10,000 Api quotas in about 3-4 hours.If you can't accept it, you can uninstall it.The sixth question is the same as this question.

# 6.Why sometimes click the button without any feedback?
The YouTube Data Api may have more than 10,000 quotas. YouTube officially limits 10,000 quotas per day, which is not something developers can control. If it is exceeded, it is invalid. As a result, you won’t see any performance feedback in your app, you can use it the next day, and YouTube will automatically reset the next day.

# 7.Is the paid purchase point affected by YouTube Api?
Yes, like all users, it will be limited by Youtube Api. Purchase points is just a way to get points, and there are no special permissions at the moment.So before you buy, you have to think about whether you want to continue to buy.

# 8.Unpopular list
Please review the privacy policy and FAQ before using.  If you don't view it, blame the application for not using or not satisfying your idea and giving the lowest score.  You may be blacklisted.  If the system detects that the existing points will be cleared, thanks to the support and understanding of most users.
